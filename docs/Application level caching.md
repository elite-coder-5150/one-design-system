Application-level caching refers to the practice of storing frequently accessed data in memory, typically on the server-side, in order to improve application performance and reduce the load on the database or other backend services. Here are some key aspects of application-level caching:

1.  Types of data to cache: The types of data that are good candidates for caching are those that are expensive to compute, frequently accessed, and relatively static. Examples include database query results, API responses, rendered HTML pages, and user sessions.
    
2.  Caching strategies: There are several caching strategies to choose from, such as time-based expiration, LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction, and key-based invalidation. The choice of strategy depends on the nature of the data being cached and the requirements of the application.
    
3.  Caching layers: In larger applications, caching can be implemented at multiple layers, such as at the web server, application server, and database levels. Each layer can have its own caching strategy and configuration, depending on the specific requirements of the application.
    
4.  Cache coherence: Cache coherence refers to the consistency of the data between the cache and the backend data store. To ensure cache coherence, it is important to have mechanisms in place to invalidate or update the cache when the underlying data changes.
    
5.  Cache performance: The performance of the cache depends on several factors, such as the size of the cache, the caching strategy, and the efficiency of the caching implementation. Monitoring and tuning the cache performance is an important aspect of application-level caching.
    

In summary, application-level caching can help improve application performance by reducing the load on backend services and speeding up access to frequently accessed data. However, it requires careful planning and implementation to ensure cache coherence and optimal performance.
